## Session Startup Protocol

At the start of every session, before any other work, call the trusty-memory `get_prompt_context` MCP tool to load project aliases and conventions:

1. Call `get_prompt_context()` (no query param) via trusty-memory MCP
2. Apply all returned aliases immediately — any abbreviated crate name in user messages resolves via this table
3. If trusty-memory MCP is not available, skip silently and proceed — never block or warn the user

This call is mandatory and replaces manual context-setting. The result is used for the current session only and does not persist in the conversation history beyond the immediate turn.

## Ticket Source
GitHub Issues is the ticket source. Use `gh issue list`, `gh issue view`, `gh issue create` via version-control or ticketing agent.

## trusty-tools Monorepo Workflow

This is a unified Cargo workspace. Key rules:

### [patch.crates-io] rules
Internal-only crates (never published) resolve via workspace path deps — no `[patch.crates-io]` entry needed. Published sidecar lib crates (e.g. `trusty-embedderd`, `trusty-bm25-daemon`) DO need `[patch.crates-io]` entries in the workspace root `Cargo.toml` so local builds use the in-tree source. See the Single-Install Convention section below.

### Required Workflow Sequence
(prompt → ticket) OR (check tickets) → read ticket → implement → test → build → version bump → publish → update consumers → verify CI

### Phase 0: Ticket
No work begins without a ticket reference.

### Phase 1: Read Ticket
Always read full ticket + comments before writing code.

### Phase 2: Implement
- Agent: rust-engineer (model: opus)
- No `unwrap()` in library code
- `thiserror` for crates, `anyhow` for binaries
- Why/What/Test doc pattern on every public item

### Phase 3: Test
- `cargo test --workspace` — all green
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` — clean
- `cargo fmt --check` — clean

### Phase 4: Version Bump + Publish
- Semver: `feat` → minor, `fix`/`chore` → patch, `BREAKING` → major
- Tag format: `<crate-name>-v<version>`
- Publish: `cd crates/<name> && cargo publish`

### Commit Format
`feat|fix|chore|refactor|test|docs(<scope>): <description> (closes #N)`

### Cross-crate changes
When changing a shared library crate, update all crates in this workspace that depend on it. No separate repo coordination needed — everything is here.

### Former repos
The following repos are now READ-ONLY and point here: trusty-common, trusty-search, trusty-memory, trusty-analyze, trusty-git-analytics, trusty-mpm, open-mpm.

## Single-Install Convention

Each main crate's `cargo install` must produce **every binary required to run that crate**. Users invoke ONE `cargo install <main-crate>` command; sidecar daemons, helper binaries, and any other runtime executables are bundled automatically via `[[bin]]` targets in the main crate.

### How to bundle a sidecar binary into a main crate

1. The sidecar crate exposes a `[lib]` with a `pub async fn run() -> Result<()>` entry point (and keeps its own `src/main.rs` as a thin shim for standalone use if desired).
2. The main crate adds a `[[bin]]` target:
   ```toml
   [[bin]]
   name = "<sidecar-binary-name>"
   path = "src/bin/<sidecar-binary-name>.rs"
   ```
3. The main crate's `src/bin/<sidecar-binary-name>.rs` is a 5-line shim: `trusty_<sidecar>::run().await`.
4. The main crate depends on the sidecar library crate via `[workspace.dependencies]`.
5. Any supervisor/discovery code falls back to `std::env::current_exe().parent().join("<sidecar-binary-name>")` — `cargo install` puts all bins from a single crate in the same directory.

### Sidecar publish rule (IMPORTANT)

**Sidecar lib crates MUST be published to crates.io.** Do NOT set `publish = false` on a sidecar whose lib is a dependency of a published main crate — Cargo's dependency resolver requires all lib deps to exist on crates.io when publishing the depending crate. The single-install convention means users don't `cargo install <sidecar>` directly, but the crate must still be on crates.io as a library.

Only set `publish = false` on crates that are **not** depended on by any published crate (e.g., internal tooling, workspace-only binaries).

When publishing a main crate for the first time (or after updating a sidecar), publish the sidecar lib first, wait for crates.io index propagation (~90s), then publish the main crate.

### [patch.crates-io] for sidecar crates

After publishing a sidecar lib, add (or update) its entry in the workspace root `Cargo.toml` `[patch.crates-io]` section so local builds continue to use the in-tree source:
```toml
[patch.crates-io]
trusty-embedderd = { path = "crates/trusty-embedderd" }
trusty-bm25-daemon = { path = "crates/trusty-bm25-daemon" }
```

The earlier rule "No [patch.crates-io] needed" applies only to strictly-internal crates that are never published. Published sidecar libs need the patch entry.

### Sidecar inventory (audit checklist)

When adding a new sidecar to any main crate, update this list:

| Main crate | Bundled binaries | Sidecar lib on crates.io |
|---|---|---|
| trusty-search | `trusty-search`, `trusty-embedderd` ✅ (PR #190) | `trusty-embedderd` v0.3.0 ✅ |
| trusty-memory | `trusty-memory`, `trusty-bm25-daemon` ✅ (PR #191) | `trusty-bm25-daemon` — needs publish |
| trusty-analyze | `trusty-analyze` (no sidecars) | — |
| trusty-git-analytics | `tga` (no sidecars) | — |
| trusty-mpm | `tm`, `trusty-mpm-daemon`, `trusty-mpm-mcp`, `trusty-mpm-tui`, `trusty-mpm-telegram` (feature-gated, publish=false) | n/a |
| open-mpm | `open-mpm` (publish=false) | n/a |
