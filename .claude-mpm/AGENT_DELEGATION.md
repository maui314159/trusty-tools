# Agent Delegation for trusty-tools

## Primary Agents

| Agent | Use When |
|-------|----------|
| rust-engineer (opus) | All Rust implementation, refactoring, new crates |
| research (sonnet) | Codebase investigation, architecture analysis |
| local-ops (sonnet) | cargo publish, launchd, version bumps, CI |

| ticketing (haiku) | GitHub Issues CRUD |
| qa (sonnet) | Test verification, clippy, fmt checks |

## Rust Engineer is the Primary Agent
Most work in this repo goes to rust-engineer. It should:
1. Research the codebase if needed
2. Implement the change
3. Run cargo test --workspace
4. Run cargo clippy
5. Run cargo fmt
6. Report results with raw output
