# trusty-tools — Claude Code Instructions

Unified Rust workspace consolidating the entire trusty-* AI tooling ecosystem.
22 crates — shared libraries, daemon/MCP servers, the MPM platform, and an
orchestrator — all co-located under one Cargo workspace.

## Project Overview

This is a **Rust workspace** (Cargo workspace, resolver v2, glob members
`crates/*`) under the Elastic License 2.0 (per-crate; a few crates are MIT —
see each `Cargo.toml`). The workspace version field and `rust-version` are
inherited by the `trusty-mpm-*` family; other crates set their own version.

**MSRV**: `1.88` — required for stabilised let-chains used by edition-2024 crates.

## Role & Scope

`trusty-tools` is the **single source of truth** for all trusty-* AI tooling.
It replaces seven formerly separate repos and eliminates the `[patch.crates-io]`
dance for cross-crate development. The authoritative crate list is the
`[workspace.members]` glob in the root `Cargo.toml`; every subdirectory under
`crates/` with a `Cargo.toml` is a member.

Key consumers of the shared libraries:
- **open-mpm** — MPM orchestration platform (lives in `crates/open-mpm`)
- **trusty-search** — hybrid code search daemon + MCP server
- **trusty-memory-core / trusty-memory** — memory palace storage + MCP frontend
- **trusty-analyze** — code analysis daemon (complexity, smells, quality metrics)

Work touching a shared crate (e.g. `trusty-common`, `trusty-mcp-core`) may
require bumping the dependent crate's version and verifying its tests. Always
run `cargo check` and `cargo test -p <crate>` after modifying a library crate,
then propagate changes to all crates that depend on it before committing.

## Build and Test Commands

🔴 **Single-path workflows — use exactly these commands.**

### Workspace-wide Commands

```bash
# Build all crates (development)
cargo build

# Build all crates (release/optimised)
cargo build --release

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Check (fast compile check, no codegen)
cargo check

# Lint (workspace-wide, all targets)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Format check
cargo fmt --check

# Format and fix
cargo fmt

# Run ONNX-backed integration tests (slow; skipped in CI)
cargo test -- --include-ignored

# Update dependencies (review Cargo.lock diff before committing)
cargo update

# Audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities
cargo audit   # requires: cargo install cargo-audit
```

### Individual Crate Commands

```bash
# Build a single crate (dev)
cargo build -p trusty-search

# Build a single crate (release)
cargo build --release -p trusty-search

# Check a single crate (fastest — no codegen)
cargo check -p trusty-search

# Test a single crate
cargo test -p trusty-search

# Test a single crate with a specific feature
cargo test -p trusty-common --features axum-server

# Test a single test by name within a crate
cargo test -p trusty-search -- my_test_name

# Run a binary from a specific crate
cargo run -p trusty-search -- start
cargo run -p trusty-mpm-cli -- --help

# Build only the binary, not the whole workspace
cargo build --release -p trusty-mpm-cli

# Lint a single crate
cargo clippy -p trusty-search -- -D warnings

# Test a single crate with ignored tests
cargo test -p trusty-embedder -- --include-ignored
```

### Important: Crate Names vs. Directory Names

**Crate names** match the `name` field in each crate's `Cargo.toml`, not necessarily the directory name.
Most match (e.g. `crates/trusty-search/` → `-p trusty-search`) but note these exceptions:

- `crates/trusty-git-analytics/` → `-p tga` (short name)
- `crates/open-mpm/` → `-p open-mpm`

Always verify the `name` field in the crate's `Cargo.toml` if you get a "package not found" error.

```

For the source layout of any crate, read its `README.md` or browse
`crates/<name>/src/`. Each crate owns its own `README.md` covering purpose,
usage, and design notes.

## Key Conventions

🔴 **Why/What/Test doc pattern** — every public item (function, struct, trait,
module) carries three comment sections:

```rust
/// Why: <motivation — the problem this solves, not the mechanics>
/// What: <mechanical description of what the item does>
/// Test: <where coverage lives, or why it is side-effect-only / untestable>
pub fn my_function() { … }
```

Never omit this pattern on public items. It is the primary way future readers
understand design intent without reading git history.

🔴 **No `unwrap()` in library code** — use `?` with `anyhow::Result` for
application/binary code and `thiserror` for library error types. Reserve
`expect()` only for cases that are genuinely programmer errors (invariants that
can never occur at runtime).

🔴 **`thiserror` for libraries, `anyhow` for binaries** — library crates
(`trusty-common`, `trusty-mcp-core`, etc.) define structured error enums with
`#[derive(thiserror::Error)]`. Binary and daemon crates use `anyhow::Result`
throughout.

🔴 **Feature flags** — `trusty-common` gates `axum` and `tower-http` behind the
`axum-server` feature flag. Do not add axum as an unconditional dependency in
any library crate. Enable it explicitly in crates that serve HTTP.

🟡 **Rust editions** — `edition = "2024"` for `trusty-mpm-*` and `open-mpm`
(they use let-chains); `edition = "2021"` for all other crates. Check the crate
`Cargo.toml` before assuming an edition.

🟡 **No global state** — all helpers are free functions or small structs. No
`lazy_static!` or `once_cell::sync::Lazy` except the tracing subscriber (which
uses `try_init` to be idempotent across test binaries).

🟡 **Logs to stderr** — `init_tracing` always writes to stderr so stdout stays
clean for MCP JSON-RPC framing. Never log to stdout in a daemon or MCP server.

🟡 **Ignore-tagged integration tests** — ONNX-backed embedder tests are marked
`#[ignore]` to keep CI fast. Run with `cargo test -- --include-ignored` when
you need local validation against the model.

🟢 **Workspace dependency sharing** — all shared external crates (`anyhow`,
`serde`, `tokio`, `axum`, etc.) are declared once in `[workspace.dependencies]`
in the root `Cargo.toml` and referenced as `dep = { workspace = true }` in
crate manifests. Never pin a dependency locally if it is already in the
workspace table.

🟢 **Internal path deps** — reference sibling crates as:
```toml
trusty-common = { workspace = true }
```
The workspace manifest declares the path so every member resolves from the
in-tree source automatically. The `[patch.crates-io]` block in the root
`Cargo.toml` also redirects any crates that still reference the old published
versions by version number.

## Git Tag / Release Convention

Each crate is tagged independently using the pattern `<crate-name>-v<version>`,
e.g. `trusty-mcp-core-v0.2.0`. The version comes from the crate's `Cargo.toml`.

Release workflow:
1. Bump the crate version in `crates/<name>/Cargo.toml`.
2. Update any dependent crates that pin that version.
3. Run `cargo test -p <name>` and `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`.
4. Commit the version bump.
5. Create the tag: `git tag <crate-name>-v<version>`.
6. Push the tag: `git push origin <crate-name>-v<version>`.
7. Publish: `cargo publish -p <crate-name>`.

The `trusty-mpm-*` family shares a single workspace version (declared under
`[workspace.package]`) and is bumped together.

## Cross-Crate Development Workflow

Because all crates are in the same workspace, the `[patch.crates-io]` dance
that was required with separate repos is no longer necessary for active
development. Cargo resolves internal crates via path automatically.

When you modify a library crate:
1. Edit the crate under `crates/<lib>/`.
2. Run `cargo check` to catch compilation errors across the entire workspace.
3. Run `cargo test -p <lib>` for the modified library.
4. Run `cargo test -p <consumer>` for each crate that depends on the library.
5. Commit all changes together — workspace builds are atomic.

When publishing a crate to crates.io:
- The path dep in `[workspace.dependencies]` coexists with the version field,
  so `cargo publish` sees the version and uploads correctly.
- The `[patch.crates-io]` block in the root `Cargo.toml` ensures the in-tree
  crates are preferred during local builds even if a published version exists.

## Crate-Specific Notes

### trusty-common
- Provides `openrouter_chat` (one-shot) and `openrouter_chat_stream` (SSE /
  tokio mpsc). Both require `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to be passed by the caller —
  the library never reads environment variables directly.
- Provides `init_tracing`, port-walking helpers, and daemon address utilities.
- `axum-server` feature gates axum, tower, and tower-http. Do not enable unless
  the crate serves HTTP.

### trusty-embedder
- `FastEmbedder` defaults to `AllMiniLML6V2Q` (INT8 quantised, ~22 MB, 384-dim).
- Falls back to full-precision `AllMiniLML6V2` (~86 MB) when the quantised
  model is unavailable.
- Output dimension: **384**.

### trusty-common axum Middleware Stack
`with_standard_middleware` applies in this order:
1. `CorsLayer` — any origin/methods/headers (for local browser UIs)
2. `TraceLayer` — HTTP request spans
3. `CompressionLayer` — gzip, with `text/event-stream` excluded (SSE compat)

### trusty-memory-core / trusty-memory
- Licensed **MIT** (not Elastic-2.0). Check before assuming the workspace
  default license applies.
- `trusty-memory` (directory: `trusty-memory`) embeds a compiled Svelte UI via `rust-embed`.

### trusty-mpm-gui
- Tauri-based desktop GUI. Its `src-tauri/` subdirectory contains a nested
  Cargo manifest that is excluded from the workspace glob to prevent Cargo from
  treating it as a second member.

### open-mpm
- The top-level MPM orchestration platform. Consumes `trusty-search`,
  `trusty-memory-core`, and `trusty-symgraph`.
- Uses edition 2024 and let-chains extensively.

### trusty-analyze
- Directory `crates/trusty-analyze/`, **package name `trusty-analyzer`**, binary
  `trusty-analyze`. Use `cargo run -p trusty-analyzer -- ...` or
  `cargo check -p trusty-analyzer`.
- Licensed **MIT** (not Elastic-2.0).
- Edition 2021. Uses tree-sitter 0.26 to share the `links = "tree-sitter"` slot
  with `open-mpm` and `trusty-symgraph`. Do not pin tree-sitter 0.24 here — it
  will collide with the rest of the workspace.
- Hard runtime dependency on `trusty-search`: the daemon performs a startup
  health check against `GET <search-url>/health` (default
  `http://127.0.0.1:7878`) and exits 1 if unreachable. There is no offline mode.
- Listens on port 7879 (HTTP API + MCP). Optional ONNX-backed NER lives behind
  the `ner` feature flag (`--features ner`).
- Facts store persisted via redb at the daemon's working directory.

## Development Environment

### Required Tools

- **Rust**: `rustup` with the toolchain pinned to MSRV `1.88` or later.
  Install: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
- **Node / pnpm**: only needed if working on the Svelte UIs embedded in
  `trusty-search` or `trusty-memory`. Install pnpm via `npm i -g pnpm`.
- **Git**: standard; the workspace uses git tags for per-crate releases.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | `trusty-search` `/chat`, `trusty-common` chat helpers | LLM chat via OpenRouter. Pass as argument to library helpers; never read from env inside library crates. |
| `RUST_LOG` | all daemons | Tracing filter, e.g. `RUST_LOG=debug` or `RUST_LOG=trusty_search=debug,warn`. |
| `TRUSTY_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` | `trusty-search` | Soft RSS ceiling for indexing pipeline. Auto-tuned from system RAM; override only when needed. |
| `TRUSTY_MAX_CHUNKS` | `trusty-search` | Hard cap on chunks per index. Auto-tuned; rarely set manually. |
| `TRUSTY_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` | `trusty-search` | ONNX embedding batch size. Auto-tuned; set if OOM during reindex. |
| `TRUSTY_EMBEDDING_CACHE` | `trusty-search` | LRU embedding cache capacity (entries). |
| `ORT_DYLIB_PATH` | `trusty-search` (CUDA, glibc < 2.38) | Path to `libonnxruntime.so` on hosts with glibc < 2.38 and CUDA builds. |
| `SKIP_UI_BUILD` | `trusty-search` `build.rs` | Set to `1` to skip the Svelte UI build step (CI publish flows). |

### Recommended IDE Setup

**VS Code / Cursor**:
- Install `rust-analyzer` extension.
- Install `Even Better TOML` for `Cargo.toml` editing.
- Workspace-level `rust-analyzer` picks up the root `Cargo.toml` automatically;
  no per-crate `.vscode/settings.json` needed.
- Recommended settings in `.vscode/settings.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "rust-analyzer.cargo.features": "all",
    "rust-analyzer.checkOnSave.command": "clippy"
  }
  ```

**RustRover**: open the repo root; it detects the workspace automatically.

### Running Individual MCP Servers Locally

Each MCP server reads from stdin / writes to stdout (JSON-RPC 2.0 framing).
All daemons log to **stderr** — never stdout.

```bash
# trusty-search daemon (HTTP + MCP stdio)
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -p trusty-search -- start
# Query via CLI
cargo run -p trusty-search -- query "fn authenticate" --index <id>
# MCP stdio mode (used by Claude Code via .mcp.json)
cargo run -p trusty-search -- serve

# MPM daemon
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -p trusty-mpm-daemon --bin trusty-mpmd

# MPM CLI (tm / trusty-mpm)
cargo run -p trusty-mpm-cli -- --help

# trusty-memory (MCP server + embedded Svelte UI)
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -p trusty-memory

# Build a specific binary in release mode
cargo build --release -p trusty-search
./target/release/trusty-search start
```

To wire a locally-built binary into Claude Code, update your project's
`.mcp.json` or `~/.claude/mcp.json` to point `command` at the absolute path
of the built binary (e.g. `target/release/trusty-search`).

## Common Pitfalls

🔴 **Using `unwrap()` in library crates** — the compiler does not stop you, but
it violates the project's hard rule. Use `?` with `thiserror` error types in
libraries. `expect()` is allowed only for invariants that genuinely cannot
occur at runtime (not for "I think this will always be Some").

🔴 **Logging to stdout in a daemon or MCP server** — MCP JSON-RPC framing uses
stdout as the transport channel. A stray `println!` corrupts the protocol.
Always use `tracing::info!` / `tracing::debug!` etc. (which write to stderr).

🔴 **Adding `axum` as an unconditional dependency in a library crate** — put it
behind the `axum-server` feature flag, matching the pattern in `trusty-common`.
Otherwise every library consumer pulls in the full axum + tower stack.

🟡 **Editing a shared crate without propagating changes** — modifying
`trusty-common`, `trusty-mcp-core`, `trusty-embedder`, or `trusty-symgraph`
can silently break dependents. Always run `cargo check` (workspace-wide) and
`cargo test -p <consumer>` for every crate that imports the edited library.

🟡 **Forgetting the Why/What/Test doc pattern on new public items** — clippy
does not enforce this. Review public APIs manually before committing.

🟡 **Building the Svelte UI manually before `cargo build`** — `trusty-search`
uses `build.rs` to invoke pnpm if `ui-dist/` is stale. If pnpm is not
installed, the build script fails loudly. Install pnpm or set
`SKIP_UI_BUILD=1` if you are not changing the UI.

🟡 **`[patch.crates-io]` only works at the workspace root** — do not add
`[patch]` tables inside individual crate `Cargo.toml` files; Cargo ignores
them. All patches must live in the root `Cargo.toml`.

🟢 **MSRV drift** — the workspace pins `rust-version = "1.88"`. Running
`rustup update` and picking up a new nightly may introduce syntax that
compiles locally but fails on CI. Prefer stable channel toolchains.

🟢 **Edition mismatch** — `trusty-mpm-*` and `open-mpm` use edition 2024;
all other crates use edition 2021. Let-chains (`if let … && let …`) only
work in edition 2024. Do not copy let-chain patterns into edition-2021 crates.
