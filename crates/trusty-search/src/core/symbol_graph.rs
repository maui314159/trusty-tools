//! `SymbolGraph`: petgraph-backed call graph derived from the chunk corpus.
//!
//! Why: query intent like "who calls `authenticate`?" or "what does `process_request`
//! delegate to?" can't be answered well by BM25/HNSW alone. A directed call graph
//! (caller → callee) lets the search pipeline expand around a hit, surfacing
//! adjacent code at a discounted score (KG-expansion = 0.7 × trigger RRF score).
//!
//! What: a `petgraph::DiGraph<SymbolNode, ()>` keyed by symbol name (the
//! `function_name` recorded on each `RawChunk` — qualified for Rust methods, e.g.
//! `Foo::bar`). Edges point from caller symbol to callee symbol. The graph is
//! cheap to rebuild from the corpus and is held in `Arc<SymbolGraph>` so search
//! handlers can read concurrently without locking.
//!
//! Test: see the `tests` module — covers basic build, `callers_of`, `callees_of`,
//! 1-hop and 2-hop traversal, qualified-method names, and unknown-symbol queries.
