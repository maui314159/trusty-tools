//! `CodeIndexer`: hybrid HNSW + BM25 + RRF search pipeline.
//!
//! Why: this is the central orchestrator that ties embeddings, vector search,
//! lexical search, and intent-based weight routing into a single `search()` call.
//! What: holds an `Embedder`, a `VectorStore`, and an in-memory chunk corpus;
//! `search()` runs both lanes in parallel, fuses with RRF, and returns the
//! top-k chunks with their fused score and per-result `match_reason`.
//! Test: see the `tests` submodule — RRF unit coverage lives in `search::rrf`,
//! and the integration test `test_search_integration` indexes 3 chunks and
//! verifies the most-relevant one ranks first.
//!
//! Module layout (issue #96 — god-object split):
//!   * `mod.rs` (this file): types, free helpers, struct definition, constructors.
//!   * `ingest`: add/index/batch parse+embed/commit pipeline.
//!   * `persist`: snapshot/restore + background incremental persist.
//!   * `files`: remove + lookup + entity-exact-match helpers.
//!   * `search`: hybrid query pipeline (HNSW + BM25 + RRF + KG + MMR).
//!   * `tests`: every test in one place so private fields stay accessible.
