//! Service-level mapping from `PathBuf` → chunk IDs currently in the index.
//!
//! Why: `CodeIndexer` exposes `add_chunk` / `remove_chunk` keyed by chunk ID,
//! but the [`crate::service::watcher::FileWatcher`] only knows file paths. We must
//! remember which chunk IDs a given file produced so a subsequent
//! `WatchEvent::Removed` can drop them. Tracking this in core would couple
//! the indexer to filesystem semantics; keeping it at the service layer keeps
//! `trusty-search-core` filesystem-agnostic.
//!
//! What: A thread-safe `HashMap<PathBuf, Vec<String>>` behind an `RwLock`.
//! Insert is `O(chunks)`; lookup is `O(1)`; takes ownership of the chunk-id
//! list on removal so the caller can iterate without holding the lock.
//!
//! Test: covered indirectly via [`crate::service::watch_loop`] integration tests.
