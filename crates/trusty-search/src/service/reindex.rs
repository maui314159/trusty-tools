//! Reindex orchestration with SSE progress tracking.
//!
//! Why: A full reindex of a project may touch hundreds or thousands of files.
//! The CLI wants to render a progress bar; the daemon wants to fire-and-forget.
//! This module bridges the two via `tokio::sync::broadcast` channels and a
//! per-index `ReindexProgress` snapshot stored on `SearchAppState`.
//!
//! What:
//! - `ReindexProgress` — current state of a reindex (status counters + replay
//!   buffer + broadcast sender).
//! - `spawn_reindex` — kick off a background task that walks `root_path`,
//!   indexes each file, and emits progress events.
//!
//! Test: see `crates/trusty-search-service/src/reindex.rs#tests`.
