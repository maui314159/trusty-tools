//! Shared helper that builds a `CodeIndexer`, attempting to restore a
//! previously-persisted HNSW snapshot and chunk corpus from disk.
//!
//! Why (issue #85): both `POST /indexes` and the daemon-startup
//! `restore_indexes` hook need the same logic — construct the indexer, wire
//! the embedder, attempt to load HNSW + chunks, and fall back to an empty
//! index on any failure. Centralising this prevents drift between the two
//! call sites (and the inevitable "the warm-boot path silently runs in
//! BM25-only mode" footgun).
//! What: `build_indexer_with_persisted_state` returns a fully-wired
//! `CodeIndexer`. On a corrupt or missing snapshot it falls back to a fresh
//! empty store + corpus and logs at WARN/INFO so operators can tell which
//! path was taken.
//! Test: covered by integration tests in `tests/integration_tests.rs` that
//! drop a state directory, restart, and assert the corpus is intact.
