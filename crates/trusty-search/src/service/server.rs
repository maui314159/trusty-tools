//! HTTP daemon: axum router exposing the trusty-search REST API.
//!
//! Why: Single shared `SearchAppState` (wrapped in `Arc`) lets every handler
//! read from the `IndexRegistry` concurrently. `DashMap` shard-locks per index
//! so different indexes never contend, and `Arc<RwLock<CodeIndexer>>` allows
//! many simultaneous readers per index.
//!
//! What: Routes implement the API described in `CLAUDE.md`:
//! - `GET /health`
//! - `GET /indexes`                       list registered indexes
//! - `POST /indexes`                      register a new (empty) index
//! - `GET /indexes/:id/status`            chunk count + root path
//! - `POST /indexes/:id/search`           hybrid search
//! - `POST /indexes/:id/index-file`       add/update one file
//! - `POST /indexes/:id/remove-file`      drop a file's chunks
//! - `POST /indexes/:id/reindex`          fire-and-forget full reindex
//!
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-search-service` boots the router with an
//! in-process registry and exercises each endpoint.
