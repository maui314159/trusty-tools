//! Embedder worker pool with priority lanes (issue #41 Phase 1).
//!
//! Why: Before this module, all embedding work flowed through a single
//! `Arc<dyn Embedder>` whose ONNX session is internally serialised by a
//! `Mutex<TextEmbedding>`. Combined with the machine-wide `Semaphore(1)` in
//! `service/reindex.rs`, a long-running reindex would block search queries
//! that arrived mid-flight (their embedding step had to wait behind the
//! reindex's hundreds of `embed_batch` calls). The pool restores
//! responsiveness for interactive search by introducing a strict priority
//! ordering — interactive requests always drain before background requests —
//! and bounds outstanding work so the daemon cannot OOM under burst load.
//!
//! What: A fixed pool of N async worker tasks, each holding an
//! `Arc<dyn Embedder>` clone (the underlying model is shared via Arc; FastEmbedder
//! already serialises ONNX inference internally). Requests arrive on two
//! `mpsc` channels — `interactive_tx` and `background_tx` — and workers
//! drain interactive first via `tokio::select!` with `biased;`. Callers
//! get a `oneshot::Receiver<Result<Vec<Vec<f32>>>>` back from `embed()`.
//!
//! Worker count is autotuned from system RAM (`trusty-search`'s
//! `core::memory_policy::detect_total_ram_mb`):
//!   - `<= 16 GB`  -> 1 worker
//!   - `17-32 GB`  -> 2 workers
//!   - `>  32 GB`  -> 4 workers
//!
//! `TRUSTY_EMBED_WORKERS` overrides the autotune.
//!
//! Test: see `tests` module at the bottom — covers worker count autotune,
//! priority ordering (interactive drains before background), shutdown, and
//! error propagation.
