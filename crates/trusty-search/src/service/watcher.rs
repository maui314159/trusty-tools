//! Filesystem watcher that emits debounced [`WatchEvent`]s for an indexed root.
//!
//! Why: The daemon must keep its in-memory HNSW + chunk corpus in sync with
//! disk without re-scanning entire trees. We piggy-back on `notify` (kqueue /
//! fsevent / inotify) and a 500ms debounce window so editor save-storms do not
//! produce duplicate work.
//!
//! What: [`FileWatcher::start`] spawns a `notify-debouncer-mini` watcher on a
//! background thread; events are translated into [`WatchEvent`] and forwarded
//! through an `UnboundedSender` so the consumer can `await` them in a tokio
//! task. The debouncer is held inside the returned struct — dropping it stops
//! the watcher cleanly.
//!
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-search-service watcher` writes a file in a
//! `tempfile::TempDir` and asserts that a `Modified` event arrives within 1s.
