//! trusty-search CLI binary.
//!
//! Why: Single entry point that exposes both project-scoped commands
//! (`search`, `watch`, `status`, `init`, `add`, `remove`, `reindex`) which
//! auto-detect the index from the current working directory, and global
//! commands (`list`, `query`, `health`, `start`, `stop`, `serve`, `completions`)
//! that operate across the registry or manage the daemon.
//!
//! What: Parses CLI args via clap and dispatches to the per-subcommand
//! handlers in [`crate::commands`]. All implementation lives in those
//! modules; this file is purely a clap-to-handler shim plus a top-level
//! error printer.
//!
//! Test: `cargo run -- --help` → renders grouped command list with aliases.
//! `cargo run -- status` from inside this repo → prints `[trusty-search]`
//! detected via `.git`. `cargo test --workspace` → all tests pass.
