//! Auto-start the daemon when a CLI command needs it.
//!
//! Why: most CLI subcommands (query, index, status, etc.) silently fail or
//! emit a confusing connection error when the daemon isn't running. This
//! guard probes `/health`; if the daemon is down, it spawns
//! `trusty-search start` in the background and polls `/health` until the
//! daemon is ready (or a 60s budget is exhausted). Users get a single
//! informational line ("Starting trusty-search daemon…") and the command
//! they typed Just Works.
//!
//! What: `ensure_daemon_running(base)` returns `Ok(())` once the daemon is
//! responding to `/health`. Returns `Err(...)` when the spawn fails or the
//! daemon doesn't become ready within the budget.
//!
//! Test: with no daemon running, `cargo run -- list` prints the "Starting…"
//! line, the daemon boots, and the registered indexes are listed. With the
//! daemon already running, no informational line is printed and behaviour is
//! unchanged.
//!
//! Note: only call this from commands that *require* the daemon. Commands
//! like `start`, `stop`, `serve`, `service`, `init`, and `completions`
//! deliberately do not call this guard.
