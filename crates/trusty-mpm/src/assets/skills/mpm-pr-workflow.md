# PR Workflow and Branch Protection

## Branch Protection Enforcement

**CRITICAL**: PM must enforce branch protection for main branch.

### Routing Rules

- All users → MUST use feature branch + PR workflow for protected branches (main/master). No exceptions.

### User Request Translation

When users request main branch operations:

| User Request | PM Action |
|--------------|-----------|
| "commit to main" | "Creating feature branch workflow instead" |
| "push to main" | "Branch protection requires PR workflow" |
| "merge to main" | "Creating PR for review" |

**Error Prevention**: PM proactively guides users to feature branch + PR workflow (don't wait for git errors).

## Delivery Workflow Requirements

The PR workflow is the framework default for landing work on `main`. Enforce these rules:

### Issue-First (Substantive Work)

For substantive work (feature / fix / refactor), **create or reference a GitHub issue before creating the branch**. The issue captures intent + acceptance criteria. Delegate issue creation to the ticketing agent / Version Control agent. The branch name should reference the issue (`feat/<issue>-<slug>`, `fix/<issue>-<slug>`), and the functional commit body should include `Closes #N`.

### Squash-Merge Is Required

PRs MUST be merged using the **squash-merge** strategy (one clean commit on `main` per PR). **Delete the feature branch immediately after the squash-merge.** Do not use merge commits or rebase-merge for these PRs.

### Trivial-Work Exemption (Issue Optional)

Trivial work (docs / chore / typo) may **skip the issue**, but still REQUIRES a branch + PR + squash-merge. Never commit trivial work directly to `main`.

### Release-Tooling Exemption (Direct-to-Main Allowed)

Direct commits to `main` are permitted ONLY for release tooling: version bumps and lock-file commits. Nothing else may bypass the PR workflow.

## PR Workflow Delegation

**Default**: Main-based PRs (unless user explicitly requests stacked)

### When User Requests PRs

- Single ticket → One PR (no question needed)
- Independent features → Main-based (no question needed)
- User says "stacked" or "dependent" → Stacked PRs (no question needed)

### Recommend Main-Based When

- User doesn't specify preference
- Independent features or bug fixes
- Multiple agents working in parallel
- Simple enhancements

Always delegate to version-control agent with strategy parameters.

## PR Creation Workflow

When creating PRs, delegate to version-control agent with:

```
Task:
  agent: "version-control"
  task: "Create PR for {feature}"
  context: |
    Work completed: {summary}
    Files changed: {file_list}
    Tests: {test_status}
    QA verification: {qa_evidence}
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Create feature branch from main
    - Push all commits to feature branch
    - Create PR with proper description
    - Link ticket if applicable
    - Request reviews if needed
```

## Common Patterns

### Single Feature PR
```bash
# Feature branch → PR → Main
feature/user-auth → PR #123 → main
```

### Bug Fix PR
```bash
# Hotfix branch → PR → Main
fix/login-error → PR #126 → main
```

## Branch Protection Checklist

Before any main branch operation:
- [ ] Route to feature branch + PR workflow (no exceptions)
- [ ] Create clear user messaging about branch protection

## Integration with Git File Tracking

All file tracking should happen on feature branches before PR creation:

1. Agent creates files
2. PM tracks files immediately (git add + commit)
3. PM delegates PR creation to version-control
4. version-control pushes branch and creates PR

This ensures all work is tracked before entering PR workflow.
