//! CLI entry point for the `trusty-memory` binary.
//!
//! Why: ship a thin clap-to-handler shim so users can `cargo install
//! trusty-memory` and invoke either `trusty-memory serve` (the MCP stdio
//! server consumed by Claude Code) or `trusty-memory migrate kuzu-memory`
//! (which rewrites Claude settings files that still reference the legacy
//! kuzu-memory MCP server). All real logic lives in the library and the
//! `commands::migrate` module — this file does CLI parsing and dispatch only.
//! What: defines a `clap::Parser` with `serve` and `migrate` subcommands.
//! `serve` defers to `trusty_memory::run_stdio` (or `run_http` when `--http`
//! is supplied); `migrate` defers to `commands::migrate::handle_migrate`.
//! Test: `cargo run -p trusty-memory -- --help` lists both subcommands.
//! `cargo run -p trusty-memory -- migrate kuzu-memory --dry-run` exercises
//! the migrate path end-to-end without modifying any files.
