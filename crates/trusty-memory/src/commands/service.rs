//! Handler for `trusty-memory service` (macOS launchd integration).
//!
//! Why: launchd is the canonical way to keep a long-lived foreground daemon
//! alive on macOS — it survives logout, restarts on crash, and integrates with
//! `launchctl` for diagnostics. Wrapping the plist mechanics in `service`
//! subcommands keeps users from having to hand-edit XML. This mirrors the
//! pattern used by `trusty-search service`, sharing the
//! [`trusty_common::launchd`] implementation so the two tools cannot drift.
//! What: macOS routes to `service_install` / `service_start` / `service_stop`
//! / `service_logs`. Non-macOS prints a "not supported" error and exits 1.
//! Test: on Linux, every action returns Err with the platform message; on
//! macOS, `service install` writes the plist without loading it, `start`
//! bootstraps it, `stop` boots it out, and `logs` tails the log files.
