//! MCP server (stdio + HTTP/SSE) for trusty-memory.
//!
//! Why: Claude Code and other MCP-aware clients integrate with trusty-memory
//! through the standardized Model Context Protocol; we expose memory + KG
//! tools so they can be called by name.
//! What: Provides `run_stdio` (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout) and `run_http`
//! (axum HTTP/SSE stub), plus an `AppState` that carries the shared
//! `PalaceRegistry`, on-disk data root, and a lazily-initialized embedder.
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-memory-mcp` validates handshake + dispatch.
