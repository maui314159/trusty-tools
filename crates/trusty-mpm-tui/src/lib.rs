//! trusty-mpm TUI coordinator dashboard library.
//!
//! Why: operators need one conversational surface — the *coordinator chat* —
//! that has visibility into every active Claude Code session, with a
//! dismissable session sidebar beside it. Exposing the dashboard as a library
//! lets the unified `trusty-mpm tui` subcommand reuse it without a separate
//! binary.
//! What: a ratatui app that polls the daemon's coordinator-context endpoint on
//! a timer, renders the [`dashboard`] panes, and POSTs typed messages to the
//! coordinator-chat endpoint. Rendering and HTTP are split into the
//! [`dashboard`] and [`client`] modules so the logic is unit-testable.
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-mpm-tui` covers chat/session formatting and the
//! client; `trusty-mpm tui` launches the live dashboard.
