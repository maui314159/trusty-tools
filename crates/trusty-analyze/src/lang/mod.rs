//! Language-specific static analysis adapters for trusty-analyzer.
//!
//! Why: Each supported language needs its own tree-sitter grammar walk to
//! extract symbols (functions, classes, imports) into a language-neutral
//! `KgGraph`. This crate isolates per-language code from the analyzer service
//! and from the workspace-wide types in `trusty-common`.
//!
//! What: Defines the `LanguageAnalyzer` trait, file-extension-based language
//! detection, and a set of adapters: Rust and TypeScript/JavaScript are
//! fully implemented; Python, Java, and Go are stubbed for Phase 2b.
//!
//! Test: each adapter has a unit test that parses a minimal source snippet
//! and asserts at least one expected node is extracted.
