//! Unified-diff review: parse a git diff and produce a per-file quality report,
//! cross-referenced against the trusty-search indexed corpus.
//!
//! Why: PR review is the highest-leverage moment to flag complexity and smells —
//! before code lands. The `review` CLI command, `POST /review` endpoint, and
//! `review_diff` MCP tool all feed a unified diff to [`analyze_diff_with_client`]
//! (or the lower-level [`analyze_diff_with_chunks`]) and get back a structured
//! [`ReviewReport`]. Like every other analyzer command, review requires
//! trusty-search to be running: it pulls the index's existing chunk corpus so
//! the report can surface trusty-search's already-computed complexity scores,
//! call-graph context, and blame for the chunks the diff touches.
//!
//! What: [`DiffParser`] turns a unified diff into [`FileDiff`]s carrying the
//! added line numbers + added content per file. [`analyze_diff_with_chunks`]
//! merges those diffs with the index's [`CodeChunk`] corpus — for files that
//! are already indexed it reports the indexed chunks' complexity and flags
//! which ones the diff modifies; for files not yet indexed (new files) it
//! falls back to tree-sitter local analysis of the added content.
//!
//! Test: see `mod tests` — covers single/multi-file diffs, hunk header parsing,
//! rename/new-file handling, grade aggregation, recommendation synthesis, and
//! the indexed-vs-new-file merge logic.
