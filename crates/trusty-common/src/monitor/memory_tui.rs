//! Service-specific terminal UI for the trusty-memory daemon.
//!
//! Why: operators of the trusty-memory daemon want a focused terminal surface
//! — a palace list, a streaming activity log of dream / drawer / recall
//! events, and a recall query bar — rather than the generic two-daemon
//! dashboard. Living in `trusty-common` behind the `monitor-tui` feature keeps
//! the pure state / rendering testable (issue #34).
//! What: a ratatui app with a 3-zone layout (title bar, PALACES + right-hand
//! split, RECALL input bar). The PALACES list always leads with an "All
//! palaces" entry that fans recalls out across every palace; the right side is
//! split vertically into an ACTIVITY feed (top) and a STATISTICS panel
//! (bottom), both scoped to the selected palace — or aggregated when "All" is
//! selected. It polls the daemon every 2 seconds, subscribes to the `/sse`
//! event stream on startup, runs cross-palace recalls from the input bar on
//! `[Enter]`, and triggers a dream cycle on `[d]`.
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-common --features monitor-tui` covers the pure
//! state, the "All" selector, palace row formatting, the activity / statistics
//! line builders, and dream-event logging; `trusty-memory monitor tui`
//! launches the live UI.
