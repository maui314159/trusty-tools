//! Louvain community detection over the `KnowledgeGraph` adjacency.
//!
//! Why: The dream cycle (issue #53) needs to identify clusters of tightly-
//! related entities and, conversely, sparse "knowledge gaps" — communities
//! whose internal density is too low to support inference. The classical
//! Leiden algorithm has no maintained Rust crate, so we implement the
//! original Louvain modularity-optimisation algorithm in-tree. Leiden's
//! phase-2 refinement can be layered on later if false-positive gaps
//! appear in practice.
//! What: Builds an in-memory undirected adjacency snapshot of the KG, runs
//! Louvain (phase 1: greedy modularity gain per node; phase 2: collapse
//! communities into super-nodes; iterate until Q stabilises), then
//! classifies each community as a `KnowledgeGap` when its internal density
//! is below 0.2 AND its outgoing bridge count does not exceed its size.
//! Test: `crates/trusty-common/tests/community_tests.rs` covers two-cluster
//! detection, gap classification on a sparse star graph, dense-clique
//! rejection, full-node coverage of the partition, and the convenience
//! `KnowledgeGraph::knowledge_gaps` shim.
