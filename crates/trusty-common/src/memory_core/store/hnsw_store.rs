//! Pure-Rust HNSW vector store backed by redb (issue #50, Phase 3).
//!
//! Why: `UsearchStore` depends on the C++ `usearch` library via FFI, which
//! pulls a native build-time toolchain into every downstream consumer and
//! prevents pure-Rust cross-compiles. `hnsw_rs` 0.3 is a pure-Rust HNSW
//! implementation; pairing it with the existing redb knowledge-graph
//! database lets us persist raw vectors (postcard-encoded `Vec<f32>`) in a
//! table and rebuild the in-memory graph on palace open. Doing so also
//! eliminates the JSON `key_map` sidecar that `UsearchStore` carries: the
//! UUID → vector_id mapping now lives in a redb table.
//! What: `HnswStore` owns an `Arc<redb::Database>` plus an
//! `Hnsw<f32, DistCosine>` rebuilt from the `VECTORS` redb table on `open`.
//! `upsert` writes both to redb (`VECTORS` + `VECTOR_KEYS`) and inserts into
//! the in-memory index. `delete` writes a tombstone to `DELETED_VECTORS`
//! (the in-memory `hnsw_rs` graph does not support removal); searches
//! filter tombstoned ids. `compact_orphans` scans `VECTORS` for entries
//! that no longer have a `VECTOR_KEYS` mapping and removes them.
//! Test: See module-level tests covering upsert+search round-trip,
//! tombstoned deletes, hydration on reopen, and orphan compaction.
