//! Multi-process concurrent open support for redb-backed palace storage.
//!
//! Why: redb takes an exclusive `flock(LOCK_EX)` on every database file, so
//! a second process attempting to open the same `kg.redb` or
//! `index.usearch.redb` while the HTTP daemon owns it fails with
//! `DatabaseError::DatabaseAlreadyOpen`. Issue #59 demands that the stdio
//! MCP client and the HTTP daemon coexist: writers must still go through
//! the daemon, but the stdio client must be able to *read* the same palace
//! state without the daemon being forced offline.
//!
//! Strategy: when an exclusive open fails with `DatabaseAlreadyOpen`, copy
//! the database file to a process-local snapshot path under the system tmp
//! directory and open that snapshot as a fresh redb database. The snapshot
//! is owned exclusively by *this* process so redb's lock check succeeds.
//! The snapshot represents a point-in-time read of the live database — it
//! is sufficient to serve `recall`, `kg_query`, and `palace_info` from the
//! stdio MCP client while the daemon continues to write to the original
//! file. Writes against a snapshot-mode store return a clear "palace is
//! read-only" error rather than silently diverging from the daemon's view.
//!
//! What: `try_open_or_snapshot` returns `(Arc<Database>, OpenMode)` and
//! `SnapshotGuard` cleans up the snapshot file on drop.
//! Test: `snapshot_fallback_when_locked` opens a file twice in one process
//! by holding the first handle while opening the second — the second open
//! falls back to a snapshot and read transactions still succeed.
