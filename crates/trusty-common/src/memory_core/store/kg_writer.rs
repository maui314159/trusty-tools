//! Per-palace background write actor that coalesces KG / drawer writes.
//!
//! Why: Before this module, every public write (`KnowledgeGraph::assert`,
//! `KnowledgeGraph::retract`, `KnowledgeGraph::upsert_drawer`,
//! `KnowledgeGraph::delete_drawer`) ran on a `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`
//! handle and opened its own `redb::begin_write` → `commit` pair. Bulk
//! workloads (e.g. `kg_assert` called in a loop, or a dream cycle that
//! upserts dozens of drawers) therefore paid one fsync per op and
//! contended on redb's exclusive write lock across concurrent callers.
//! Issue #59 follow-up: introduce a single-writer-per-palace actor that
//! (a) serialises all writes through one `mpsc` channel so callers no
//! longer race on the underlying `Database` lock, and (b) coalesces ops
//! that land within a small (~10 ms) window into a single redb write
//! transaction, collapsing N fsyncs into one. Each caller still `await`s
//! a `oneshot::Receiver`, so success is only reported after the batch is
//! committed — no write loss.
//!
//! What: `KgWriter` owns an `Arc<KgStoreRedb>` and an `mpsc::Sender`. The
//! background task `writer_loop` blocks on `recv()` for the first op,
//! then drains any further ops already buffered on the channel (up to a
//! configurable cap, default 64). If the drained batch has >1 op, the
//! whole set is committed via `KgStoreRedb::apply_batch`; if exactly 1
//! op, it goes through the corresponding single-op method for symmetry.
//! Errors are reported per-op via the matching `oneshot::Sender`. The
//! actor shuts down cleanly when the last sender drops.
//!
//! Test: `writer_serialises_concurrent_asserts`,
//! `writer_batches_burst_into_single_commit`,
//! `writer_reports_error_per_op`, `writer_drops_cleanly_on_shutdown`.
