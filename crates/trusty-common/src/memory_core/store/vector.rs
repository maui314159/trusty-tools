//! Vector store trait and HNSW implementation backed by redb (issue #51).
//!
//! Why: Issue #51 — the previous backend (`usearch`) pulled a C++ FFI build
//! dependency into every consumer. This module now exposes the same
//! `UsearchStore` type name (preserved as the public contract used by
//! `PalaceHandle`, dream, retrieval, and the `TrustyBackedMemoryStore`
//! adapter), but the internals are pure-Rust: an `HnswStore` (issue #50)
//! that persists raw vectors in a redb file. The type name is kept for
//! backward compatibility while the rest of the codebase still references
//! `UsearchStore`; downstream renames can happen incrementally.
//! What: `VectorStore` async trait + `UsearchStore` wrapping `HnswStore`.
//! `upsert`/`search`/`remove` run on `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` so the
//! sync `HnswStore` API doesn't stall the async reactor. UUIDs are
//! converted to/from strings at the boundary (HnswStore keys are strings).
//! On `new()`, if a legacy `<path>` usearch index file is present (and the
//! `usearch-migrate` feature is compiled in), its contents are drained
//! into the redb-backed HNSW index and the legacy file is renamed to
//! `<path>.migrated`.
//! Test: `upsert` then `search` returns the inserted id at rank 0 with
//! score at least 0.99 for an identical query vector; `remove` then
//! `search` no longer returns the removed id; reopening the store from
//! the same path retrieves previously inserted vectors.
