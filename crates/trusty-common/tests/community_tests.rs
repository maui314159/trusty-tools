//! Integration tests for the Louvain community detection module
//! (`memory_core::community`, issue #52).
//!
//! Why: Validates both the partition correctness (Louvain finds the
//! expected two clusters on a barbell-style graph; partition covers every
//! node) and the gap-classification logic (sparse star → gap, dense
//! clique → not a gap). All tests construct a real `KnowledgeGraph` so
//! the snapshot pipeline from petgraph adjacency through to the algorithm
//! is exercised end-to-end.
//! What: Builds small synthetic graphs via `KnowledgeGraph::assert`, runs
//! `find_communities` / `partition` / `knowledge_gaps`, and asserts on
//! the resulting structures.
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-common --features memory-core --test
//! community_tests`.
