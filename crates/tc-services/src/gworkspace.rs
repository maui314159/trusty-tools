//! Google Workspace service bridge — Calendar + Tasks subset.
//!
//! Why: The Trusty personas need Google Calendar and Tasks access. The
//! authenticated Google API client + per-service handlers already live in
//! `trusty-gworkspace`; this module is a thin host-agnostic *bridge* that
//! emits OpenAI-compatible schemas and dispatches calls — the same shape as
//! `cto_db.rs` and `granola.rs` — so open-mpm, trusty-izzie, and future
//! consumers reuse one surface instead of re-deriving it.
//! What: One `GworkspaceService` per published tool. Phase 2 scope is
//! Calendar (`manage_calendars`, `manage_events`, `query_free_busy`) and
//! Tasks (`manage_task_lists`, `manage_tasks`, `list_tasks`, `complete_task`)
//! only — Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides are deliberately excluded.
//! Each service pulls its schema from `trusty_gworkspace::tools` and
//! dispatches via the matching `trusty_gworkspace::api::services` handler.
//! `execute()` constructs a `BaseClient` (read-only token mode when OAuth
//! env vars are absent) and runs the call.
//! Test: `gworkspace_services_lists_seven`, `schema_round_trips`,
//! `service_for_unknown_name`, `execute_errors_without_credentials`.
