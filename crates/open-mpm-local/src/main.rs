//! Why: Published `open-mpm` cannot depend on private (publish=false) agent
//!      crates. This private binary wires local agents into the open-mpm
//!      plugin registry before starting the server, giving a full-featured
//!      local build without polluting the published crate.
//! What: Installs the cto-assistant plugin, then delegates to open_mpm::run().
//! Test: `cargo run -p open-mpm-local` starts the MPM server with CTO tools.

    // What: Registers the cto-assistant persona before `run()` so the ctrl
    //       loop sees its `AgentPlugin` when it builds tool surfaces.
    // Test: Indirectly covered by running `open-mpm-local` and confirming
    //       the cto-assistant persona exposes its CTO DB tools.
