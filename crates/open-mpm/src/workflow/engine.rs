//! `WorkflowEngine` — iterates phases, runs each agent, threads outputs.
//!
//! Why: The prescriptive Research -> Plan -> Code -> QA -> Observe flow
//! needs a deterministic driver that feeds each phase's output into the
//! next via templates. An explicit engine keeps that orchestration logic
//! out of `main.rs` and behind a testable seam (`AgentRunner`).
//! What: `WorkflowEngine` holds an `Arc<dyn AgentRunner>` and a config dir;
//! `run(name)` loads the JSON, iterates phases, records outputs, writes
//! `workflow-report.md` to `out_dir` after the `observe` phase (if present).
//! Test: With a mock `AgentRunner` that returns fixed outputs per agent,
//! `run()` should produce a populated context and invoke the runner once
//! per phase. (This is exercised via integration; unit tests cover the
//! sub-pieces: config parsing, context templating.)

/// subprocess and only sees stdout (the final JSON envelope) and stderr
/// (logging). To surface live phase progress to the Tauri UI poller, we emit
/// a single-line, prefix-tagged JSON record on stderr per phase event so the
/// server can parse those lines out of the stream and update the stored
/// `PmResponse.phases_completed` in real time. Other stderr lines pass

/// What: Writes `__OMPM_PROGRESS__ {<json>}\n` to stderr. The prefix is
/// chosen to be unmistakable so accidental log-line collisions are nil.
