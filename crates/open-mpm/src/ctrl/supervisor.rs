//! CTRL supervisor — `om session run` workflow executor with retry and escalation (#408).
//!
//! Why: `om session new` is fire-and-forget — it spawns a session and returns. There is
//! no way to ask the harness "drive this task to completion and tell me what happened".
//! The supervisor closes that gap: it creates a CTRL session record, invokes the
//! prescriptive workflow as a subprocess, parses `workflow-report.md`, and either
//! reports success, retries with an amended task on partial/failure (up to a
//! caller-specified `max_attempts`), or escalates with a "Blocked: <reason>" message
//! plus the last-known next-steps so the user can pick up where the loop gave up.
//!
//! What: `CtrlSupervisor` owns the project dir, task text, agent, and attempt budget.
//! `run()` performs the create-session / spawn-workflow / parse-report / retry loop and
//! returns a `SupervisorOutcome` (success or blocked). Pure parsing helpers
//! (`parse_workflow_report`, `amend_task_for_retry`) are exposed for unit testing.
//!
//! Test: `test_parse_workflow_report_success`, `test_parse_workflow_report_partial`,
//! `test_supervisor_retry_task_amendment` cover parsing and amendment without
//! shelling out. End-to-end behavior is exercised manually by `om session run`.
