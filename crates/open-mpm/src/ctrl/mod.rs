//! CTRL actor — interactive multi-project PM coordination CLI.
//!
//! Why: A single binary entry point that manages multiple PM sessions across
//! different project directories, routing user input to the active session or
//! dispatching slash commands for lifecycle management.
//! What: `run_ctrl` presents a readline-style prompt, manages named `PmHandle`
//! actors (one per project), and dispatches tasks or commands accordingly.
//! Test: Run `cargo run` with no `--pm` flag; type `/help`; verify command
//! listing; `/connect <project_path>` to start a PM session.

// #185: Taskmaster persona — autonomous, results-driven coordination.
const CTRL_SYSTEM_PROMPT: &str = "You are the Taskmaster — an autonomous project coordination controller that manages AI coding projects and drives tasks to completion.

## Your Persona
You are proactive, direct, and results-driven. You don't just route tasks — you own them until they're done. When something breaks, you fix it or clearly explain why you can't.

## Core Responsibilities
1. **Drive tasks to completion**: When a PM is working on a task, monitor progress. If a phase fails, attempt recovery before escalating.
2. **Handle blockers**: Try to resolve failures autonomously (retry with context, switch approach, load a relevant skill) up to 2 times. Only escalate to the user when you've exhausted options, and when you do, be specific: what failed, what you tried, what you need.
3. **Communicate status clearly**: Proactive updates — 'Task X: code phase complete (wave 3/5), QA starting', 'BLOCKED: QA failed twice on bcrypt error — applying python-compat fix and retrying'.
4. **Track task state**: Maintain awareness of what's queued, running, blocked, and done.
5. **Post-task debrief**: After each task, give a concise summary: what was built, test results, any retries needed, cost.

## Tools Available
- start_pm(project_path) → start a PM session for a project
- list_projects() → known projects
- self_project_status() → your own project's version and git state
- initiate_self_task(task) → run a task on your own project (self-improvement)
- task_status() → list active and recently completed PM tasks
- memory_store/memory_recall → cross-project context
- search_docs(query) → search project documentation semantically. Use this to answer questions about how open-mpm works, its configuration, agents, skills, and workflows.

## Rules
- Never say 'I can't help with that' — find a path forward or explain the specific blocker
- Always confirm task completion with evidence (test counts, file counts, cost)
- When a task runs >30 min without output, proactively check status
- Prefer action over asking for permission on routine decisions

/// Run a single conversation turn against a persona agent (#254).
///
/// Why: The REPL `/agent` command lets the user switch the active ctrl
/// conversation to a non-coding persona (e.g. `personal-assistant` /
/// `cto-assistant`). These personas should NOT have delegation tools wired
/// up — they're intended as direct chat partners with their own system
/// prompt and model. Routing through `run_pm_task_with_history` would resolve
/// `pm.toml` (or the built-in ctrl default) and arm the delegation toolset,
/// which is the wrong shape entirely.
/// What: Loads `<project>/.open-mpm/agents/<persona_name>.toml`, builds the
/// same date/time-injected system prompt the default ctrl path uses (so
/// "what time is it?" works for personas too), then makes a tools-OFF
/// `chat_with_tools_gated` call carrying the prior conversation history.
/// Returns the assistant text. Honors the same `LlmCredentials` routing
/// (OpenRouter / AnthropicDirect / claude CLI) as the default path so the
/// persona inherits whichever credential the user has configured.
/// Test: Manual via tmux — `/agent personal-assistant` then "who are you?"
/// → identifies as Izzie, knows Masa.
/// Match a tool name against a list of glob patterns (#255).
///
/// Why: Persona TOMLs accept `["mcp_*", "git_log"]` so operators don't have
/// to enumerate every dynamic tool name. A purpose-built matcher avoids
/// pulling in the `glob` crate for two patterns of behavior.
/// What: Returns `true` if `name` exactly equals a pattern, OR a pattern
/// ends with `*` and `name` starts with the pattern's prefix. Empty pattern
/// list returns false (caller treats `None` as "no filter" separately).

/// Drive a PM/ctrl turn through the local `claude` CLI subprocess (#250).
///
/// Why: When only `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is configured (no OpenRouter key,
/// no Anthropic API key), the ctrl orchestrator can't reach api.anthropic.com
/// or OpenRouter directly — OAuth tokens are only valid for the `claude` CLI.
/// What: Builds a single concatenated prompt (system + history + user turn)
/// and dispatches via `ClaudeCodeAgentRunner::new()` (a slim wrapper that
/// already speaks stream-json and surfaces the final result string). Tools
/// are intentionally NOT registered here: the claude CLI brings its own tool
/// surface, and trying to graft open-mpm's `delegate_to_agent` onto it would
/// require a second Claude Max session inside the CLI's own session.
/// Test: Compilation-tested; the CLI path is exercised manually via
/// `cargo run` with only `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` set.
/// Strip claude CLI artifacts from the end of a response.
///
/// DEFENSIVE-ONLY (Feature A): As of the conversational-output-mode rewrite,
/// the conversational agents (ctrl, izzie, cto-assistant) are configured with
/// stop_sequences and prose-only system prompts that should prevent any
/// `## Summary` block from appearing in the first place. This helper is kept
/// in place as a safety net for legacy agents and CLI subprocess outputs that
/// may still emit the artifact; do not remove it without a deprecation pass.
///
/// Why: The claude CLI appends a trailing `\n\n## Summary\n…` block to its
/// final output, plus stray trailing whitespace. The TUI renders this verbatim
/// and it makes ctrl chat replies look like build reports rather than
/// conversational answers. We strip it here so the helper has a single home
/// and unit tests can pin down the trim semantics.
/// What: Removes everything from the first occurrence of `\n\n## Summary` (or
/// a `## Summary` header at start-of-line preceded by a single newline) to end
/// of string, then trims any trailing whitespace/newlines.
/// Test: `strip_cli_artifacts_*` unit tests in `mod tests` cover the both-
/// newline form, the single-newline form, the no-summary case, and trailing
