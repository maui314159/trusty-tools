//! Core trait abstractions for tool execution, agent running, search, and skills.
//!
//! Why: DI through traits lets us swap concrete implementations (subprocess
//! runner vs. in-process mock; Brave vs. Tavily search; fs skill store vs.
//! embedded) without changing call sites. This is the SOA seam that keeps
//! the workflow engine and PM loop testable.
//! What: Defines `ToolExecutor`, `AgentRunner`, `SearchProvider`, and
//! `SkillResolver`. All are object-safe (`dyn`-able) and `Send + Sync`.
//! Test: Mock impls of each trait are constructed in unit tests for
//! `ToolRegistry`, `WorkflowEngine`, and related code.

/// budget via process-global env vars (`std::env::set_var`). That is
/// unsound in Rust 2024 because env mutation is not thread-safe under
/// multi-threaded tokio runtimes. Threading a `RunContext` through the
/// `AgentRunner` trait replaces the shared mutation with a per-call value
/// that runners can apply to the child process (via `Command::env` / `current_dir`)
/// without touching the parent's environment.
/// What: Carries optional overrides — the assigned file for single-file
/// wave-loop invocations, a per-call max-turns cap, and a working directory
/// that the runner should use as the subprocess CWD.
/// Test: Exercised indirectly through the wave-loop and runner dispatch
/// tests (`wave_loop_runs_one_agent_per_file`, runner unit tests).
