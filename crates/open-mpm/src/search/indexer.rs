//! AST-aware code indexer: walks source trees and produces function-level chunks.
//!
//! Why: Downstream semantic search needs chunks that are both small enough to
//! embed usefully and large enough to be meaningful. Splitting on AST function
//! boundaries gives exactly that — a single function (or method) becomes one
//! chunk with precise `{file, function_name, start_line, end_line}`. That in
//! turn lets search results be rendered as clickable `path:line` references.
//! What: [`CodeChunk`] is the result shape surfaced to callers;
//! [`CodeIndexer`] orchestrates file reads, AST extraction via tree-sitter,
//! embedding via the injected [`Embedder`], and persistence via the injected
//! [`MemoryStore`] under [`Segment::CodeIndex`].
//! Test: Unit tests in this file cover each language's chunker, markdown
//! heading split, fallback for files with no function nodes, and a full
//! index+search round-trip using a mock store and embedder.
