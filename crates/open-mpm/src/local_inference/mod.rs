//! Local Ollama fast-path for qualifying ctrl turns (#319).
//!
//! Why: Frequent ctrl turns (TM status, project lists, simple chat) don't
//! benefit from a remote LLM round-trip. Routing them to a locally-running
//! ollama instance gives sub-second feedback and zero token cost when ollama
//! is available. The decision must be made cheaply (no network on the hot
//! path) and must not silently degrade behavior when ollama is missing.
//! What: Two pure functions plus a cached availability probe:
//!   - `is_ollama_available(host)` — short-timeout health check.
//!   - `is_ollama_available_cached(host)` — once-per-process memoized probe.
//!   - `qualifies_for_local_inference(intent, message)` — routing predicate.
//! Test: `tests::*` cover the predicate matrix; the probe is exercised
//! manually via the `/local test` REPL command.

/// Cached result of the per-process ollama probe.
///
/// Why: `is_ollama_available` opens a TCP connection and waits for a 200 from
/// `/api/tags` — fine on startup but unacceptable on every turn. We probe
/// once and remember the answer for the rest of the process; users who start
/// ollama mid-session can re-probe via `/local test`.
/// What: `OnceLock<bool>` initialized lazily by `is_ollama_available_cached`.

/// clean fall-through to the remote model instead of a 500 on the next turn.
/// 500 ms timeout keeps the hot path responsive when the user has nothing
/// listening on the port.
/// What: GETs `<host>/api/tags`, returns `true` on a 2xx response. Any error
/// (timeout, connection refused, non-2xx) returns `false` without panicking.

/// but unreachable — graceful degradation via `fallback_on_error`.
/// What: On first call, awaits `is_ollama_available(host)` and stores the
/// result in `OLLAMA_AVAILABLE`. Every subsequent call returns the cached bool.
/// Test: Manual via `/local` (changes to ollama state after process start are
/// not reflected — by design; user can restart open-mpm to re-probe).

/// observed — `/local test` is purely diagnostic.
